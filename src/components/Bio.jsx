        I found out about programming through a korean tv drama called
        'Startups' (defintly worth the watch). Spolier alert: After seeing the
        tech nerd win the girl and create a succesful tech company. I realize I
        have been doing life all wrong. I now aspire to be the coolest nerd
        ever.

        The first step in my software developer journey was very ardouse. It
        took several months to master Stack Overflow & Google but after that
        front end was a breeze. Needless to say, I now know how to npm install
        any website with just html, css, css framework, postcss, sass, and the
        current, most popular javascript framework, and the most current,
        popular framew
        <br />
        <br />
        And no, I didn't just stop with front end. I like pain. That's why
        learned python and also ruby for some reason. And after painstakingly
        months of grinding, coffee adication, and lowerback pain from incorrect
        posture, I've discovered what backend as a services are and I now run
        all my multi billion dollar startups ideas through services like
        firebases. Now is a good time to say, I solely indentify as a frontend
        developer.
        {/* I’ll be honest. I want to change the world. I want to make an impact. I
        think I was born to be great in this era. I mean why not me? I play the
        long game. Most people worry what they’ll achieve in a year, I see
        decades into the future and how i’ll leave my footprint.
        <br />
        Ambition is not all I have. I value loyalty, compassion and believe in a
        positive sum game. I believe in heaven and i’m not afraid to go through
        the depths of hell to get there. Heck, I’ll even fight the devil to
        achieve my goals . You can probably tell, I am a extremist by nature.
        Denzel ‘The Goat’ Washington has a great quote “Small minds discuss
        people, Great minds discuss ideas”. I am fixated on becoming really good
        at taking Great ideas to Great products. Execution is my weapon and I
        want to master it. That’s why I’m building Sterling, my budgeting app.
        Can I take the concept of financial discipline and make a great product
        with it? I want invoke emotions, tell a story through technology, and
        ultimately change people’s lives for the better. Which is why i’m
        sharpening my storytelling and writing skills at Ellie, a productivity
        app. Ya boy is also marketer as well as a programmer.
        <br />
        With just the desire to succeed and a love for building things, I taught
        myself how to code. No teacher, no school. I built a ton of small
        applications, from weather apps to todo list to full scale apps, I’m
        dipping my toes in all pies. Not afraid to get downright dirty. As as
        long as I get the job done. */}
