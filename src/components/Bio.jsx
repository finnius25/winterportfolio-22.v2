        I’ll be honest. I want to change the world. I want to make an impact. I
        think I was born to be great in this era. I mean why not me? I play the
        long game. Most people worry what they’ll achieve in a year, I see
        decades into the future and how i’ll leave my footprint.

        Ambition is not all I have. I value loyalty, compassion and believe in a
        positive sum game. I believe in heaven and i’m not afraid to go through
        the depths of hell to get there. Heck, I’ll even fight the devil to
        achieve my goals . You can probably tell, I am a extremist by nature.
        Denzel ‘The Goat’ Washington has a great quote “Small minds discuss
        people, Great minds discuss ideas”. I am fixated on becoming really good
        at taking Great ideas to Great products. Execution is my weapon and I
        want to master it. That’s why I’m building Sterling, my budgeting app.
        Can I take the concept of financial discipline and make a great product
        with it? I want invoke emotions, tell a story through technology, and
        ultimately change people’s lives for the better. Which is why i’m
        sharpening my storytelling and writing skills at Ellie, a productivity
        app. Ya boy is also marketer as well as a programmer.

        With just the desire to succeed and a love for building things, I taught
        myself how to code. No teacher, no school. I built a ton of small
        applications, from weather apps to todo list to full scale apps, I’m
        dipping my toes in all pies. Not afraid to get downright dirty. As as
        long as I get the job done.
